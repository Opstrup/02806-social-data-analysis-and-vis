                <li>Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</li>
                <li class="answer">This is a answer</li>
                <li>Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words" going forward, but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).</li>
                <li>The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?</li>
                <li>I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs". What does he mean by that?</li>
                <li>What is a <em>Quantile plot</em>? What is it good for. </li>
                <li>How is a <em>Probablity plot</em> defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</li>
                <li>One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better. </li>
                <li>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</li>
                <li>The book doesn't mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot">violin plots</a>. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</li>

                <li>Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small". What do you think his argument is?</li>
                <li>Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?</li>
                <li>What are the two methods Janert metions for smoothing noisy data? Can you think of other ones?</li>
                <li>What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?</li>
                <li>Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.</li>
                <li>What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?</li>
                <li>What kind of functions will loglog plots help you see?</li>
                <li>What the h#ll is <em>banking</em> and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?</li>
                <li>I think figure 3-14 makes an important point about linear fits that is rarely made. What is it? </li>

              <p>
                As part of a homework assignment, I ask my students at Pratt to go out and chart something of interest to them, and <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fkvsavarese&amp;t=NmE2YmYyYjU4NTI3MTFhYWFiMWE1ZjFhNzc1NmUzMmE0ZDQ4OGM2NSwxeHM2a1phNg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A5jlxwUw4OZ-2SbgNDPgKMQ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fiquantny.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F129373499164%2Fthis-is-quantifiably-the-best-month-to-go-to-the&amp;m=1">Katherine Savarese</a> came back with a simple chart about farmers markets that I loved- it inspired this post.
              </p>
              <p>
                You probably know that farmers markets are a staple across <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grownyc.org%2Ffiles%2Fgmkt%2Fmap.pdf&amp;t=MGM4YmRjZjQ2ZmFmYzBiYmMzMmY5NDU2MTdiNzMzMmYyOWQ5YjQ2ZSwxeHM2a1phNg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A5jlxwUw4OZ-2SbgNDPgKMQ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fiquantny.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F129373499164%2Fthis-is-quantifiably-the-best-month-to-go-to-the&amp;m=1">all five boroughs</a> of New York City, but September happens to be a very special month.  Why is that? &nbsp;Well, it turns out September is the month with the most unique types of fresh produce- forty three to be exact.
              </p>
              <p>
                To show the current offerings, we charted how many types of fruits and vegetables are available by month, and showed if they were fresh or from storage.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <div class="col-md-3 float-right" style="margin-top: 49px;">

                <span class="dot fresh-veg"></span>
                <button type="button" id="fresh-veg" class="btn btn-secondary m-b-10">Fresh vegetables</button> <br>
                <span class="dot storage-fruit"></span>
                <button type="button" id="storage-fruit" class="btn btn-secondary m-b-10">Storage fruits</button> <br>
                <span class="dot storage-veg"></span>
                <button type="button" id="storage-veg" class="btn btn-secondary m-b-10">Storage vegetables</button> <br>
                <span class="dot"></span>

              </div>
              <div id="viz-1"></div>
              <p>
                If you miss the month of September, you might be behind the fruit curve, but there are plenty more months of vegetables left. &nbsp;The chart shows that fresh vegetables are available 9 out of 12 months, but fruit is only available 5 out of 12. Now if only we could quantify how delicious the produce isâ€¦&nbsp;
